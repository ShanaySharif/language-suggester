#### A programming language suggester webpage!


## Technologies Used
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript

## Description
In this project, I utilized HTML, css and Javascript to create a webpage that suggests a programming language to users. 
So. the users would answer three
randome/irrelevent questions and based on the yes or no answes, it will suggest  what programming 
language they should learn first. The webpage is suppose to be interactive and it illistrates my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs.
In this project I include a minumum of five survey questions and one branch will return one result. I also include branching logic by using 'if else'
statements.
